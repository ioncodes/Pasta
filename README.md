# Pasta
Do you love true italian Pasta? From a true italian? Well, my nonna taught me how to make the perfect Pasta with her secret recipe!

So I decided to make a plugin which let's you paste code like a real italian! What I mean with it? Well, we all know that italians are
lazy, so why should we take the efford to open a browser and paste the code there? We paste code within the IDE!

And the cool thing is: The syntax highlight looks as good as true italian spaghetti ;)


# Examples
[Java](http://www.ioncodes.com/Pasta/?paste=130066324657d6bc10d6fc05.93722880)

[C#](http://www.ioncodes.com/Pasta/?paste=32654273857d6bc69523557.68941830)

[PHP](http://www.ioncodes.com/Pasta/?paste=4940155457d6bca5afccb4.88722614)

[JavaScript](http://www.ioncodes.com/Pasta/?paste=171146628457d6bddc8d1749.22268356)

# Supported IDEs
## IntelliJ
The plugin is in still Beta development, but (I hope) it works!

[Download](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8618)

## Visual Studio
Since I needed to reset my Laptop I got problems on restoring the old Project! But it will come soon!

## More...
Well, how I said, italians are lazy... So why shouldn't we work together? Once the API Documentation is done, you can create your own 
Plugins!
