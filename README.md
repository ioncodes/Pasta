# Pasta
Do you love true italian Pasta? From a true italian? Well, my nonna taught me how to make the perfect Pasta with her secret recipe!

So I decided to make a plugin which let's you paste code like a real italian! What I mean with it? Well, we all know that italians are
lazy, so why should we take the efford to open a browser and paste the code there? We paste code within the IDE!

And the cool thing is: The syntax highlight looks as good as true italian spaghetti ;)

## Supproted IDEs
# IntelliJ
The plugin is in still Beta development, but (I hope) it works!

# Visual Studio
Since I needed to reset my Laptop I got problems on restoring the old Project! But it will come soon!

# More...
Well, how I said, italians are lazy... So why shouldn't we work together? Once the API Documentation is done, you can create your own 
Plugins!
